# Coursera_Capstone
Capstone project developed to obtain IBM Data Science Professional Certificate hosted in Coursera.
The project is explained in the document "Capstone report" and the code is in the notebook "Capstone".
There is also a brief presentation of this project and a notebook from another one required to obtain the certificate ("clustering_neighborhoods_toronto").
These data science projects are based on the use of geolocation data.
